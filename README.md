# Machine-Learning-Nanodegree-Dog-Breed-CNN

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project for Machine Learning Nanodegree! 
Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

### CNN Classifier using VGG16 from scratch 
The classifier uses three convolutional layers and two fully connected layers to give a test accuracy of 12%
### CNN Classifier (using Transfer Learning)
Improved performance with test accuracy of 65%
